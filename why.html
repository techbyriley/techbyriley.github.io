            <h2>Why I prefer dogs over cats</h2>
            <p>Why I like dogs more than cats is becuse they acctualy play with you. Cats don't really play with you and they just hid in your house and be boring. But dogs on the other hand you can play with them, you can walk them, you can cuddle with them, and lastly you can teach them to do tricks.</p>
